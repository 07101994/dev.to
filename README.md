# This is the public repo for dev.to

The core purpose of this repo is for feedback and discussion about the platform. Issues are available for this purpose. This repo will evolve once we foray further into open source activity.

## Feature roadmap

- Comments and upvotes
- Richer markdown experience
- Smarter "next article" suggestions, and "related podcats"

Ask about any of this, or suggest anything. We're really excited about opening this all up.
